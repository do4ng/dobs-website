Assets can be handled using the built-in assets feature.

## Asset Plugin

The asset plugin is available through `dobs/experimental`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "dobs";
import { publicPlugin } from "dobs/experimental";

import { join } from "node:path";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [publicPlugin("/", join(process.cwd(), "./public/"))],
});
```

If you plan to support [build](/docs/build), make sure to provide an absolute directory path.
