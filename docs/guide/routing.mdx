Dobs automatically generates routes based on your file tree of pages.

Route files must be located in the `/app/` directory, and all files within the `/app/` directory are treated as routes.

In the example below, the `.ts` extension is used, but the `.js` extension is also supported.

## Static Routes

| Filename      | Path     |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `/index.ts`   | /        |
| `/foo.ts`     | /foo     |
| `/foo/bar.ts` | /foo/bar |

## Dynamic Routes

| Filename          | Path       |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| `/[id].ts`        | /:id       |
| `/[id]/index.ts`  | /:id       |
| `/[id]/foo.ts`    | /:id/foo   |
| `/[...params].ts` | /:\*params |
