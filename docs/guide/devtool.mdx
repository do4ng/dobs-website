The devtool provides a simple environment where you can easily test your Dobs server.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "dobs";

export default defineConfig({
  devtool: true, // [!code ++]
});
```

After starting the server in development mode, you can access the devtool at the `/_dev_/` route.

## Cannot use devtool

The devtool is still an experimental feature and is not included in the main Dobs package due to stability and size limitations.
To use the devtool, please install the `@dobsjs/dev` package, which contains the necessary devtool assets.

```bash
npm i --save-dev @dobsjs/dev
```
