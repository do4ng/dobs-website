Dobs can be used together with other backend frameworks.

Since Dobs currently has a relatively small ecosystem, you may need to implement additional features by creating custom middleware or plugins.
For this reason, integrating Dobs into another backend framework that already has a rich ecosystem can be a practical approach.

```ts
import { createDobsServer } from "dobs";

createDobsServer({ mode: "middleware" });
```

When `mode` is set to `"middleware"`, Dobs will return an array of middleware functions.

## With Express

The following example shows how to use Dobs middleware with Express:

```js
const express = require("express");
const http = require("@dobsjs/http");
const dobs = require("dobs");

const app = express();

dobs.createDobsServer({ mode: "middleware" }).then((middlewares) => {
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    req = http.createRequest(req);
    res = http.createResponse(res);
    next();
  });
  app.use(...middlewares);
  app.listen(3000, () => console.log("server is listening on 3000"));
});
```

Because Dobs uses its own HTTP base server, you must wrap both `req` and `res` with `createRequest()` and `createResponse()` so that Dobs middleware can function correctly.

```js
app.use(
  ...middlewares.map(
    (middleware) => (req, res, next) =>
      middleware(createRequest(req), createResponse(res), next)
  )
);
```

If you do not want Dobs to modify your request and response objects, you should create independent request and response instances.
